## Description: 
Dinosaur Game is a classic, trendy browser game that can be played in Chrome’s offline page. Our goal is to create a command-line version of the dinosaur game with special powerups utilizing the Brick Library. Our initial goal is to meet the checklist below to create an easy implementation of the game. If time permits, we will implement our stretch goals which will provide additional functionality to the game. 

## Goals Checklist: 
- Implement a basic UI that includes the dinosaur as well as various obstacles in the shape of Bricks 
- Implement the Dinosaur Gameplay 
  - Players should be able to control the Dinosaur’s jumping movement
  - The obstacles should be created and positioned randomly within the side scrolling landscape 
  - Coins should be created and positioned randomly within the landscape 
- Implement a faster version of the game as the game progresses (e.g. obstacles will come towards the dinosaur at a faster pace). 
- Stretch Goals 
  - Implement a powerup that reverses the game gravity (e.g. dinosaur will be at the top of the screen)
  - More goals written below! 

## Differences: 
During our initial project research, we found a public Github repo that contains a very basic implementation of the dinosaur game. However, we will do several changes (both functionality and features)  to not simply copy the repo. We want to add coins that are collectable by the player during the game, those coins will be used with the time to determine the score. Another change that we will implement is that in the original dinosaur game, as time goes on in the game, the dinosaur moves faster and faster, increasing the difficulty. In the public repo, this is not implemented so we want to add this feature. 
Graphically, we will try to stay true to the original dinosaur game as opposed to the implementation we found which just uses blocks for everything. We will also be adding our own graphics for the power ups and coins. To finish with the changes, we want to add some power-ups and malus in the game that will change the way the game is played (reverse gravity, speed-up, black screen). That way, our game will better represent a traditional platformer game.
